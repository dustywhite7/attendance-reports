# attendance-reports
Using football match attendance data to help students become familiar with BI software.

This repository will include documents related to coursework and my materials for teaching students how to use BI software.
When I teach this material, I typically use Microsoft's PowerBI software, but any flavor should work.

The repository contains the following files:

power-bi-interface.docx (a word document detailing the basics of using Microsoft's PowerBI)
power-bi-interface.pdf (a PDF version of the above word document)
football-attendance-europe.csv (a comma-separated values file containing attendance figures for european football leagues over time,
     collected from the information available on [http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm](http://www.european-football-statistics.co.uk/attn.htm))
